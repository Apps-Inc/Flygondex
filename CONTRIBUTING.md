## Branches

We follow the [gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model, but with a few deviations.

- `main`: stable releases only
- `dev`: main development branch, all code is merged here before going into `main`
- `pokemart/*`: new features
- `pokecenter/*`: hotfixes
